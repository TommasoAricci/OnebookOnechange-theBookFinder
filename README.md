# OnebookOnechange

OnebookOnechange is a **bookfinder** that allows people to discover titles by genre using the OpenLibrary API. The goal of this initiative is to cultivate a passion for reading among individuals, spreading culture and new perspectives.

## How it works

Its operation is very easy.

In the middle of the webpage there is a **textbox** (Google style) where a user can type a genre (such as *horror*, *fantasy*, *fiction*, etc.). <br>
Clicking on the submit button the browser send the infos to the server, showing the books titles and author's names.

## The choice of design

I chose to use a library background image to create the intimate feeling that a library can provide.
I put the textarea and the submit button right in the middle of the webpage in order to have only the main things in the page.
Finally, the logo is right at the top as a header.

This design defines my minimal way to create the webpages.

The code is structured **mobile-first**.
